\section{Introduction}

This report is based on a project made during the course \href{https://learnit.itu.dk/local/coursebase/view.php?ciid=909}{DevOps, Software Evolution and Software Maintenance, MSc}. \href{https://github.com/itu-devops/lecture_notes/tree/e44664f50c8b0ffb30a77a29e305df3f6750d5d4}{Course material}. 

The project focus was on making software that can evolve, scale and be maintained. To learn this, a clone of Twitter has been created, called MiniTwit, see \autoref{fig:Minitwit_public}.

To generate traffic to the site, the professors have created a simulator see \autoref{fig:Simulator}

The service, MiniTwit could be making money on selling ads and/or user metadata. To enable discussion of the system from different views the following roles have been defined.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Product owners}: The group
    \item \textbf{Stakeholder}: The professors
    \item \textbf{Customers}: The simulator / users of the service.
\end{itemize}
